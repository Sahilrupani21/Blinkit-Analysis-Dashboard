# Blinkit-Analysis-Dashboard
Built an interactive Blinkit Sales Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze revenue, product performance, and outlet trends. Used data cleaning, modeling, and DAX to track KPIs like total sales, average sales, ratings, and item volumes, enabling insights across categories, outlet sizes, and locations for data-driven decisions.
