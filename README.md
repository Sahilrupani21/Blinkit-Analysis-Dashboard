# Blinkit-Analysis-Dashboard
Built an interactive Blinkit Sales Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze revenue, product performance, and outlet trends. Used data cleaning, modeling, and DAX to track KPIs like total sales, average sales, ratings, and item volumes, enabling insights across categories, outlet sizes, and locations for data-driven decisions.

𝗕𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 | 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗜 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 📊

In today’s rapidly growing era of quick commerce and instant delivery platforms, I was curious to explore how data drives decisions behind the scenes. As someone who frequently uses apps like Blinkit, I wanted to get hands-on experience analyzing retail and quick-commerce sales data.

This led me to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Blinkit’s sales data and uncover revenue patterns, product performance insights, and outlet-level trends using KPI-driven analytics.
